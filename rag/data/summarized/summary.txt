**V. Missing Information:**

This summary is based solely on the provided text.  Crucial information such as lease duration (outside of the special terms), payment amounts, penalties for late payments, lessee obligations, termination clauses (besides the definition of "Resigning Lessee"), and renewal terms are not included in the extract and therefore cannot be summarized.  A complete review of the entire lease agreement is necessary to obtain this information.
