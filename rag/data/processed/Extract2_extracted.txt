(b) Agreement to Lease. From time to time, subject to the terms and provisions hereof (including satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Sub-Clause 2.1(c) (Conditions Precedent to Lease of Lease Vehicles)), the Lessor agrees to lease to the relevant Lessee, and such Lessee agrees to lease from the Lessor those certain Lease Vehicles identified on Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedules and Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedules produced from time to time by or on behalf of such Lessee pursuant to Sub-Clauses 2.1(d) (Lease Vehicle Purchase and Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedules) and 2.2(b) (Intra-Lease Transfers), respectively.

No Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the Vehicle Lease Commencement Date for such Lease Vehicle or would result from the leasing of such Lease Vehicle hereunder, and no Potential Lease Event of Default with respect to any event or condition specified in Sub-Clause 9.1.1 (Events of Default), Sub-Clause 9.1.5 (Events of Default) or Sub-Clause 9.1.8 (Events of Default) shall have occurred and be continuing on the Vehicle Lease Commencement Date for such Lease Vehicle or would result from the leasing of such Lease Vehicle hereunder; (ii) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties contained in Clause 7 (Certain Representations and Warranties) are true and correct in all material respects (unless any such representation or warranty contains a materiality limitation by its terms, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct) as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty by its terms makes reference to a specific date, in which case, such representation or warranty shall be true and correct for such specific date); (iii) Eligible Vehicle.

Fleet Purchase Agreement, except for Vehicles subject to Sub-Clause 2.1(a) (Lease of Vehicles). (d) Lease Vehicle Purchases and Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedules (i) From time to time, a Lessee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Lessor one or more schedules identifying the vehicles such Lessee desires to lease from the Lessor hereunder, which schedules shall include the Basic Lease Vehicle Information (each such schedule, a “Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule”). Each Lessee hereby agrees that, upon delivery of a Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule to the Lessor, it will represent and warrant, to and in favor of the Lessor, that each condition precedent to the leasing of the Lease Vehicles identified in such Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule has been satisfied as of the date of such delivery of the relevant Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule. (ii) During the period from the Vehicle Lease Commencement Date in respect of a Lease Vehicle to the date that such Lease Vehicle is first identified on a Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule, the existence of a lease between the Lessor and the relevant Lessee in respect of that Lease Vehicle shall be evidenced and determined by reference to the records of the Lessor and such records shall constitute prima facie evidence of such lease. (iii) The Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule for each Lease Vehicle to be leased hereunder on the Closing Date shall be substantially in the form as set out in Schedule V (Form of Initial Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule). (e) Lease Vehicle Acceptance or Non-conforming Lease Vehicle Rejection. (i) Subject to Sub-Clause 2.1(e)(ii) below, with respect to any vehicle identified on a Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule and made available for lease by the Lessor to any Lessee, such Lessee shall have the right to inspect such vehicle within five (5) days of receipt (or such shorter period as may be contemplated under the applicable Vehicle Purchasing Agreement) (the “Inspection Period”) of such vehicle and either accept or, if such vehicle is a Non-conforming Lease Vehicle, reject such vehicle; provided that the relevant Lessee is not required to expressly declare its acceptance of the relevant vehicle. If such Lessee rejects the vehicle, it shall notify the Lessor in writing that such vehicle is a Non- conforming Lease Vehicle during the Inspection Period (the delivery date of such written notice, the “Rejection Date”). If such Lessee timely notifies the Lessor that such Vehicle is a Non-conforming Lease Vehicle, then such Non-conforming Lease Vehicle with respect to which such Lessee has so notified the Lessor shall be a “Rejected Vehicle”. (ii) Notwithstanding Sub-Clause 2.1(e)(i) above, a Lessee will be only entitled to reject any Vehicle delivered to it by or on behalf of the Lessor (A) if the Lessor is itself entitled to reject such Vehicle under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement pursuant to which such Vehicle was ordered and (B) subject to the same conditions (to the extent applicable) as to rejection as may be applicable to the Lessor under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement in respect of such Vehicle. (iii) The Lessor shall cause the Servicer to dispose of a Rejected Vehicle described in sub-paragraph (i) above (including by returning such Rejected Vehicle to the seller thereof in accordance with the terms of the applicable Vehicle Purchasing Agreement) in accordance with Sub-Clause 6.2 (Servicer Functions). (f) Third party representative. In making, delivering (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, electronic delivery), receiving and/or accepting declarations pursuant to this Clause 2.1 (Lease 7 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 11 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

of Vehicles), the Lessor and any Lessee may be represented by a duly authorised (bevollmächtigt) third party service provider acting in the name and on behalf of the Lessor or the applicable Lessee, respectively. The parties hereto agree that: (i) each party so represented shall deliver to the respective other party the relevant original power of attorney or the original of the relevant servicing contract containing such power of attorney, at the time of or prior to the direct declaration made, delivered (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, electronic delivery), received and/or accepted on behalf of it; (ii) each party so represented shall promptly notify the respective other party of any amendments of such power of attorney; (iii) the Lessor may only be represented by third party service providers incorporated in, and acting from, a jurisdiction other than Germany; and (iv) each party shall procure that its respective service provider shall not sub-delegate its authority to any other Person. (g) Indemnity. Each Lessee shall indemnify the Lessor in respect of any Liabilities which the Lessor may suffer in circumstances where the Lessor has purchased a Vehicle or Vehicles under an Individual Purchase Agreement (as defined pursuant to the German Master Fleet Purchase Agreement) and a lease is not entered into by the date on which the Lessor pays the purchase price for such Vehicle or Vehicles (including, without limitation, where a lease is not entered into because the conditions precedent in Clause 2.1(c) (Conditions Precedent to Lease of Leased Vehicles) are not satisfied). 2.1 Certain Transfers (a) Sales to Lessee. The Lessor may sell a Lease Vehicle during such Lease Vehicle’s Vehicle Term to the relevant Lessee for an amount equal to the market value of such Lease Vehicle. (b) Intra-Lease Transfers. From time to time, a particular Lessee (the “Transferor Lessee”) may desire to cease leasing a Lease Vehicle hereunder and another Lessee (the “Transferee Lessee”) may desire to commence leasing such Lease Vehicle hereunder. Upon delivery by such Lessees to the Lessor of written notice identifying by VIN each Lease Vehicle with respect to which the lease shall be so transferred from such Transferor Lessee to such Transferee Lessee (such notice, an “Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule”), each Lease Vehicle identified in such Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule shall cease to be leased by the Transferor Lessee and shall contemporaneously commence being leased from the Lessor to the Transferee Lessee, provided that such transfer does not result in the breach of any prescribed limits relating to Lease Vehicles set out in the Related Documents. Each Lessee agrees that upon such a transfer of the lease with respect to any Lease Vehicle from one Lessee to another Lessee pursuant to this Agreement, such Transferor Lessee relinquishes all rights that it has under such lease with respect to such Lease Vehicle pursuant to this Agreement. Each Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule may be delivered electronically and may be delivered directly by either the applicable Transferor Lessee or the applicable Transferee Lessee or on behalf of either such party by any agent or designee of such party, provided the Transferor Lessee and the Transferee Lessee shall have separately agreed to such Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule and, with respect to such agreement, may not be represented by the same agent. 2.2 [Reserved] 8 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 13 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

2.3 Return (a) Lessee Right to Return. Any Lessee may return any Lease Vehicle (other than any Lease Vehicle that has experienced a Casualty or become an Ineligible Vehicle) then leased by such Lessee at any time prior to such Lease Vehicle’s Maximum Lease Termination Date to the Servicer at the location for such Lease Vehicle’s return reasonably specified by the Servicer; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Vehicle Term for such Lease Vehicle will continue until the Vehicle Lease Expiration Date thereof, notwithstanding the prior return of such Lease Vehicle pursuant to this Sub-Clause 2.4(a) (Lessee Right to Return). (b) Lessee Obligation to Return. (i) Each Lessee shall return each Lease Vehicle leased by such Lessee on or prior to such Lease Vehicle’s Maximum Lease Termination Date to the Servicer at the location for such Lease Vehicle’s return reasonably specified by the Servicer (taking into account transportation costs and expected realizable disposition proceeds).

In addition to Sub-Clause 2.5(a) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations) and without limitation thereto, with respect to any Lease Vehicle that is a Program Vehicle leased by any Lessee hereunder as of any date of determination, such Lessee may redesignate such Lease Vehicle as a Non-Program Vehicle upon written notice to the Lessor (which written notice may be delivered electronically and may be delivered directly by such Lessee or on its behalf by any agent or designee of such Lessee); provided that, such Lessee shall not redesignate any Program Vehicle as a Non-Program Vehicle pursuant to this Sub-Clause 9 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 15 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

With respect to any Lease Vehicle that is a Non- Program Vehicle leased by any Lessee hereunder as of any date of determination, if such Lease Vehicle was previously designated as a Program Vehicle, then such Lessee may redesignate such Lease Vehicle as a Program Vehicle upon written notice to the Lessor (which written notice may be delivered electronically and may be delivered directly by such Lessee or on its behalf by any agent or designee of such Lessee); provided that, such Lessee may not redesignate any such Lease Vehicle as a Program Vehicle if such Lease Vehicle would then be required to be redesignated as a Non-Program Vehicle pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.5(a) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations) after designating such Lease Vehicle as a Program Vehicle. (d) Timing of Redesignations. With respect to any redesignation to be effected pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.5(a) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations), such redesignation shall occur as of the first calendar day of the calendar month following the date on which the applicable event or condition described in Sub-Clause 2.5(a)(i) or (ii) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations) occurs.

(e) Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignation Payments. With respect to any Lease Vehicle that is redesignated as a Non-Program Vehicle pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.5(a) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non- Program Vehicle Redesignations) or Sub-Clause 2.5(b) (Optional Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations), the Lessee of such Lease Vehicle as of the close of business on the date of such redesignation shall pay to the Lessor on the Payment Date following the effective date of such redesignation, as determined in accordance with Sub-Clause 2.5(d) (Timing of Redesignations), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Net Book Value of such Lease Vehicle over the Market Value of such Lease Vehicle, in each case, as of the date of such redesignation (such excess, if any, for such Lease Vehicle, a “Redesignation to Non-Program Amount”).

(the earliest of such three dates being referred to as the “Vehicle Lease Expiration Date” for such Lease Vehicle). (c) [Reserved] (d) Lease Vehicles with Multiple Vehicle Terms.

6 SERVICER FUNCTIONS AND COMPENSATION 6.1 Servicer Appointment ◦ German FleetCo has appointed the Servicer in accordance with this Agreement to provide the services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Servicer has accepted such appointment. In connection with the rights, powers and discretions conferred on the Servicer under this Agreement, the Servicer shall have the full power, authority and right to do or cause to be done any and all things which it reasonably considers necessary in relation to the exercise of such rights, powers and discretions in respect of the performance of the relevant services. 6.2 Servicer Functions (a) With respect to any Lease Vehicle returned by any Lessee pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.4 (Return), the Servicer shall direct such Lessee as to the return location with respect to such Lease Vehicle. The Servicer shall act as the Lessor’s agent in returning or otherwise disposing of each Lease Vehicle on the Vehicle Lease Expiration Date with respect to such Lease Vehicle, in each case in accordance with the Servicing Standard. In the event the Servicer is the Lessee, the Lessee shall act in its own capacity when returning any Program Vehicle to the Manufacturer pursuant to the applicable Manufacturer Program. (b) Upon the Servicer’s receipt of any Program Vehicle returned by any Lessee pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.4 (Return), the Servicer shall return such Program Vehicle to the nearest related Manufacturer’s designated return facility or official auction or other facility designated by such Manufacturer at the sole expense of the Lessee thereof unless paid or payable by the Manufacturer thereof in accordance with the terms of the related Manufacturer Program.

In the event that the sale price is proposed to be at a price which is outside of the guidelines agreed with the Lessor, the Servicer shall seek for approval by the Lessor such that the Lessor either confirms that such sale complies with any guidelines agreed between the Lessor and the Servicer in this respect or any individual instructions from the Lessor. (d) In connection with the disposition of any Lease Vehicle that is a Program Vehicle, the Servicer shall comply with the Servicing Standard in connection with, among other things, the delivery of any documents of transfer signed as necessary, signed condition reports and signed odometer statements to be submitted with such Program Vehicles returned to a Manufacturer pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.4 (Return) and accepted by or on behalf of the Manufacturer at the time of such Program Vehicle’s return. (e) Upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, the Servicer shall dispose of any Lease Vehicles in accordance with the instructions of the Lessor or the German Security Trustee.

For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Potential Lease Event of Default or Lease Event of Default, if the event or condition giving rise (directly or indirectly) to such Potential Lease Event of Default or Lease Event of Default, as applicable, ceases to be continuing (through cure, waiver or otherwise), then such Potential Lease Event of Default or Lease Event of Default, as applicable, will cease to exist and will be deemed to have been cured for every purpose under the German Related Documents. 9.2 Effect of Lease Event of Default. ◦ If any Lease Event of Default set forth in Sub-Clause 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.1.5, 9.1.6 or 9.1.8 (Events of Default) shall occur and be continuing, the relevent Lessee’s leases with respect to any Lease Vehicles leased hereunder shall be subject to the Lessor’s option to terminate such leases as set forth in Sub-Clause 9.3 (Rights of Lessor Upon Lease Event of Default) and 9.4 (Liquidation Event and Non-Performance of Certain Covenants). 9.3 Rights of Lessor and German Security Trustee Upon Lease Event of Default 1.1.1 If a Lease Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, then the Lessor may proceed by appropriate court action or actions available to it under German law to enforce performance by any Lessee of the applicable covenants and terms of this Agreement or to recover damages for the breach hereof calculated in accordance with Sub-Clause 9.5 (Measure of Damages). 1.1.2 If any Lease Event of Default set forth in Sub-Clause 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.1.5, 9.1.6 or 9.1.8 (Events of Default) shall occur and be continuing, then (i) subject to the terms of this Clause 9.3.2, the Lessor or the German Security Trustee (acting on the written instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee (whose instructions, in turn, have been obtained in accordance with the terms of the German Security Trust Deed and the Issuer Security Trust Deed)) shall have the right to serve notice on the other parties hereto whereby any Lessee’s leases hereunder of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles leased hereunder by such Lessee are terminated, a “Master Lease Termination Notice”, and following service of such notice shall have the right to (a) take possession of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles leased by any 32 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 58 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

Lessee hereunder the lease of which has been so terminated and (b) peaceably enter upon the premises of any Lessee or other premises where Lease Vehicles may be located and take possession of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles and thenceforth hold, possess and enjoy the same free from any right of any Lessee, or its successors or assigns, and to use such Lease Vehicles for any purpose whatsoever and (ii) the Lessees, at the request of the Lessor or the German Security Trustee (whose instructions, in turn, have been obtained in accordance with the terms of the German Security Trust Deed), shall return or cause to be returned all Lease Vehicles to and in accordance with the directions of the Lessor or the German Security Trustee as the case may be. ◦ The Lessor may not validly serve a Master Lease Termination Notice unless such decision to serve the Master Lease Termination Notice has been approved by any independent director (as the term may be defined in the relevant constitutional documents of the Lessor) on the board of directors of the Lessor. 1.1.3 Each and every power and remedy hereby specifically given to the Lessor will be in addition to every other power and remedy hereby specifically given or now or hereafter available to it under German law and each and every power and remedy may be exercised from time to time and simultaneously and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Lessor; provided, however, that the measure of damages recoverable against such Lessee will in any case be calculated in accordance with Sub-Clause 9.5 (Measure of Damages). All such powers and remedies will be cumulative, and the exercise of one will not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other or others. No delay or omission of the Lessor in the exercise of any such power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any payments due hereunder will impair any such power or remedy or will be construed to be a waiver of any default or any acquiescence therein; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any exercise of any such right or power shall remain subject to each condition expressly specified in any Related Document with respect to such exercise. Any extension of time for payment hereunder or other indulgence duly granted to any Lessee will not otherwise alter or affect the Lessor’s rights or the obligations hereunder of such Lessee. The Lessor’s acceptance of any payment after it will have become due hereunder will not alter or affect the Lessor’s rights hereunder with respect to any subsequent payments or defaults therein. 9.4 Liquidation Event and Non-Performance of Certain Covenants (a) If a Liquidation Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the German Security Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee shall have the rights against each Lessee and the German Collateral provided in the German Security Trust Deed and Issuer Security Trust Deed, upon a Liquidation Event, including, in each case, the right to serve a Master Lease Termination Notice on the other parties hereto and following service of such notice shall have the right (i) to take possession of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles leased by any Lessee hereunder the lease of which has been terminated and (ii) to peaceably enter upon the premises of any Lessee or other premises where Lease Vehicles may be located and take possession of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles and thenceforth hold, possess and enjoy the same free from any right of any Lessee, or its successors or assigns, and to use such Lease Vehicles for any purpose whatsoever. (b) During the continuance of a Liquidation Event, the Servicer shall return any or all Lease Vehicles that are Program Vehicles to the related Manufacturers in accordance with the instructions of the Lessor. To the extent any Manufacturer fails to accept any such Program Vehicles under the terms of the applicable Manufacturer Program, the Lessor shall have the right to otherwise dispose of such Program Vehicles and to direct the Servicer to dispose of such Program Vehicles in accordance with its instructions. (c) Notwithstanding the exercise of any rights or remedies pursuant to this Sub-Clause 9.4 (Liquidation Event and Non-Performance of Certain Covenants), the Lessor will, nevertheless, have a right to recover from such Lessee any and all amounts (for the avoidance of doubt, as limited by Sub-Clause 9.5 (Measure of Damages)) as may be then due. 33 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 60 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

(e) The German Security Trustee may only take possession of, or exercise any of the rights or remedies specified in this Agreement with respect to, such number of Lease Vehicles necessary to generate disposition proceeds in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay each German Note with respect to which a Liquidation Event is then continuing as set forth in the German Facility Agreement, taking into account the receipt of proceeds of all other vehicles being disposed of that have been transferred to secure such German Note. 9.5 Measure of Damages If a Lease Event of Default or Liquidation Event occurs and the Lessor or the German Security Trustee exercises the remedies granted to the Lessor or the German Security Trustee under Sub-Clause 8.7 (Preservation of rights), this Clause 9 (Default and Remedies Therefor) or Sub-Clause 10.2 of the German Facility Agreement, the amount that the Lessor shall be permitted to recover from any Lessee as payment shall be equal to: (i) all Rent for each Lease Vehicle leased by such Lessee hereunder to the extent accrued and unpaid as of the earlier of the date of the return to the Lessor of such Lease Vehicle or disposition by the Servicer of such Lease Vehicle in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all other payments payable under this Agreement by such Lessee, accrued and unpaid as of such date; plus (ii) any reasonable out-of-pocket damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses that the Lessor or the German Security Trustee will have sustained by reason of such a Lease Event of Default or Liquidation Event, together with reasonable sums for such attorneys’ fees and such expenses as will be expended or incurred in the seizure, storage, rental or sale of the Lease Vehicles leased by such Lessee hereunder or in the enforcement of any right or privilege hereunder or in any consultation or action in such connection, in each case to the extent reasonably attributable to such Lessee; plus (iii) interest from time to time on amounts due from such Lessee and unpaid under this Agreement at EURIBOR plus 1.0% computed from the date of such a Lease Event of Default or Liquidation Event or the date payments were originally due to the Lessor by such Lessee under this Agreement or from the date of each expenditure by the Lessor or the German Security Trustee, as applicable, that is recoverable from such Lessee pursuant to this Clause 9 (Default and Remedies Therefor), as applicable, to and including the date payments are made by such Lessee. 9.6 Servicer Default Any of the following events will constitute a default of the Servicer (a “Servicer Default”) as that term is used herein: (i) the failure of the Servicer to comply with or perform any provision of this Agreement or any other Related Document and such failure is, in the opinion of the German Security Trustee materially prejudicial to the German Noteholders and in the case of a default which is 34 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 62 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

In the event of a Servicer Default, the Lessor or the German Security Trustee, in each case acting pursuant to Sub-Clause 9.24(d) (Servicer Default) of the German Facility Agreement, shall have the right to replace the Servicer as servicer with a replacement servicer which shall be appropriately licensed. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Servicer Default, if the event or condition giving rise (directly or indirectly) to such Servicer Default ceases to be continuing (through cure, waiver or otherwise), then such Servicer Default will cease to exist and will be deemed to have been cured for every purpose under the German Related Documents. 9.7 Application of Proceeds The proceeds of any sale or other disposition pursuant to Sub-Clause 9.2 (Effect of Lease Event of Default) or Sub-Clause 9.3 (Rights of Lessor Upon Lease Event of Default) shall be applied by the Lessor in accordance with the terms of the German Related Documents. 10 CERTIFICATION OF TRADE OR BUSINESS USE Each Lessee hereby warrants and certifies that it intends to use the Lease Vehicles that are subject to this Agreement in connection with its trade or business. 35 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 64 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

SCHEDULE III Required Contractual Criteria for Vehicle Purchasing Agreements 1 PROVISIONS TO BE APPLIED TO ALL VEHICLE PURCHASING AGREEMENTS TO BE ENTERED INTO BY GERMAN FLEETCO OR GERMAN OPCO Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will in substance satisfy the following contractual requirements: 1.1 Parties Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will satisfy the following criteria: (a) the rights and obligations of each of German FleetCo and German OpCo shall in all cases be several and not joint (nicht gesamtschuldnerisch); and (b) German FleetCo shall not under any circumstances have any liability for the obligations of German OpCo arising under or in connection with such agreement. 1.2 Confidentiality (a) Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will provide that, subject only as provided in sub-paragraph (b) below, none of German FleetCo, German OpCo or the Supplier may disclose the terms of such agreement to any third party (other than their Affiliates, agents and professional advisors, and the agents and professional advisors of their Affiliates) without the prior written consent of: (i) in the case of disclosure by German FleetCo or German OpCo, the Supplier; and (ii) in the case of disclosure by the Supplier, German FleetCo and German OpCo, • provided always that such prohibition on disclosure shall not apply to any disclosure in accordance with any requirement of or direction by any regulatory body or authority or as otherwise required by applicable law. (b) Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will permit German FleetCo to disclose any term of the agreement in connection with any proposed issue of securities which is secured, directly or indirectly, on any Relevant Vehicle or German FleetCo’s rights under the agreement (each, a “Finance Transaction”): (i) to any Affiliate of German Fleetco or any issuer, security trustee, lead manager or arranger (or any person appointed in a similar role), rating agency, servicer (debt service manager), monoline insurer or any other person providing credit support or enhancement for a proposed Finance Transaction, as well as their agents, professional advisors and Affiliates; provided that any person to whom disclosure is made under this sub-paragraph (i) shall be under a duty of confidentiality in connection with such information; (ii) to any regulatory body or authority in accordance with any requirement of or direction by these authorities; and (iii) (other than in relation to any Initial Purchase Price, Repurchase Price or any requirement in relation to the number of Relevant Vehicles required to be purchased by German OpCo pursuant to the agreement) pursuant to any prospectus, preliminary prospectus or investor presentation prepared in connection with a proposed Finance 52 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 93 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM

Transaction; provided that such disclosure is consistent with requirements under any applicable law, regulation, listing rule or stock exchange requirement. 1.3 Volume Rebates etc. A Vehicle Purchasing Agreement may provide that any bonus payment or other amount (howsoever described) payable or to be made available by a Manufacturer /Dealer as a result of German FleetCo (or German FleetCo and/or German OpCo (and/or any other relevant Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation) under such Vehicle Purchasing Agreement and/or any German OpCo Specific Agreement, as applicable) meeting any minimum vehicle purchase level in that relevant year, be payable to or for the account of German OpCo (rather than German FleetCo). For the avoidance of doubt, German FleetCo may however take the benefit of reductions applied to purchase prices applicable to vehicles as a result of any such minimum vehicle purchase levels being reached. Notwithstanding the foregoing where a Vehicle Purchasing Agreement provides that in the event that any minimum vehicle purchase level in the relevant year is not met: (a) any bonus, payment, benefit or reductions applied to purchase prices on Vehicles purchased by German FleetCo or other amount (howsoever described) is recoverable by or repayable to a Manufacturer /Dealer; or (b) any penalty or other amount (howsoever described) is payable to such Manufacturer /Dealer, such Vehicle Purchasing Agreement shall provide that, in each case, such amounts will only be reclaimed from, payable by, or otherwise recoverable from German OpCo or another Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than German FleetCo. 1.4 Non-petition Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will contain an irrevocable and unconditional covenant and undertaking given by the relevant Supplier that, until the date falling one year and one day after the Legal Final Payment Date, such Supplier shall not petition or take any step for: (a) the liquidation, insolvency or any similar or analogous proceedings or circumstances of German FleetCo; or (b) the appointment of an insolvency officer in relation to German FleetCo or any of its assets, provided that the aforementioned limitations shall not apply in respect of liabilities for (i) damages caused intentionally or by gross negligence (grobe Fahrlässigkeit) or by a negligent (fahrlässig) breach of any material contractual obligation (vertragswesentliche Pflicht) by German FleetCo or (ii) damages to persons (Personenschäden). Material contractual obligations (vertragswesentliche Pflichten) are any obligations whose fulfilment is necessary for the proper execution of the contract and whose observance contractual partners regularly rely upon. 1.5 Limited recourse Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will contain an irrevocable and unconditional covenant and undertaking given by the relevant Supplier that, until the date falling one year and one day after the Legal Final Payment Date, such Supplier shall not take any step for any legal proceedings to recover any amount owed to it by German FleetCo under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement, provided that the aforementioned limitations shall not apply in respect of: (a) liabilities for (i) damages caused intentionally or by gross negligence (grobe Fahrlässigkeit) or by a negligent (fahrlässig) breach of any material contractual obligation (vertragswesentliche Pflicht) by German FleetCo or (ii) damages to persons (Personenschäden).

necessary for the proper execution of the contract and whose observance contractual partners regularly rely upon; and (b) legal proceedings against German FleetCo to the extent that the only relief sought against German FleetCo pursuant to such proceedings is the re-possession of a Relevant Vehicle pursuant to applicable retention of title provisions provided for under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement. 1.6 Assignment (a) Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will contain terms that permit both German FleetCo and the Supplier to assign or pledge their respective rights under such agreement or (with regard to the Supplier) any other vehicle purchase contract without the need to obtain the consent of each other or a third party. (b) The Vehicle Purchasing Agreements will not permit German FleetCo or the Supplier to transfer any of its respective obligations thereunder without the prior written consent of each other party to the agreement. 1.7 Termination provisions Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will entitle the parties to terminate such agreement subject to and in accordance with the terms thereof, provided that the Supplier shall not at any time be entitled to terminate its repurchase obligations in relation to any Relevant Vehicle (each an "Repurchase Obligation", together the "Repurchase Obligations") which has previously been shipped to or to the order of German FleetCo, provided further that the provisions of paragraph 1.5 (Non- petition), 1.6 (Limited recourse) and 2.1 (Set-off) shall survive termination of a Vehicle Purchasing Agreement. The right of any party to terminate any Vehicle Purchasing Agreement for just cause (Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund) shall remain unaffected. 2 PROVISIONS TO BE APPLIED TO ALL MANUFACTURER PROGRAMS TO BE ENTERED INTO BY A GERMAN FLEETCO Each Manufacturer Program will in substance satisfy the following additional contractual requirements: 2.1 Set-off (a) Subject to paragraph 2.1(b) below, Manufacturer Programs may provide that the Supplier may set off amounts owed by it to German FleetCo against amounts owed to it by German FleetCo or by German OpCo under that Manufacturer Program or any other Vehicle Purchasing Agreement which have been finally adjudicated (rechtskräftig festgestellt) or which are uncontested (unbestritten) by German FleetCo or German OpCo, respectively. (b) Each Manufacturer Program will provide that the Supplier may not, however, set off any other amounts owed to it by German OpCo (including unpaid Initial Purchase Price in relation to Vehicles, including Relevant Vehicles, delivered to or to the order of German OpCo, or ordered by the German OpCo) against amounts owed by the Supplier to German FleetCo (in particular, any amounts in respect of the Repurchase Price) under that Manufacturer Program or any other Vehicle Purchasing Agreement, save and except in relation to any Manufacturer Program with Daimler AG and/or any of their respective Affiliates or successors or any corporation into which such entities may be merged or converted or with which they may be consolidated or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation of such entities (“Daimler Entities”) or any Dealers or agents (or Affiliates or successors thereof) selling Vehicles manufactured or purchased from the Daimler Entities if such Manufacturer Program does not provide for waiver of set-off in accordance with this 54 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 97 of 102 1/27/25, 12:45 AM
