THIS AGREEMENT (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof, this “Agreement”), is made on 25 September 2018, amended and restated on 29 April 2021 and further amended and restated on 21 December 2021 between the following parties: (1) RAC FINANCE SAS, an entity established in France with its principal place of business in Beauvais, whose registered office is at Immeuble Diagonale Sud 6 Avenue Gustave Eiffel Bâtiment A1, 78180, Montigny-le- Bretonneux, 497 581 498 RCS Versailles , France (“French FleetCo”), as lessor (in such capacity, the “Lessor”); (2) HERTZ FRANCE SAS, an entity established in France having its registered address at 1/3 avenue Westphalie, Immeuble Futura 3, 78180 Montigny Le Bretonneux, France (“French OpCo”), as a lessee and as servicer (in such capacity as servicer, the “Servicer”); and (3) those various Permitted Lessees (as defined herein) from time to time becoming Lessees hereunder pursuant to Clause 12 (Additional Lessees) hereof (each, an “Additional Lessee”), as lessees (French OpCo and the Additional Lessees, in their capacities as lessees, each a “Lessee” and, collectively, the “Lessees”); (4) BNP PARIBAS TRUST CORPORATION UK LIMITED, acting through its registered office at 10 Harewood Avenue, London NW1 6AA, as French security trustee (in such capacity, the “French Security Trustee”); and (5) BNP PARIBAS TRUST CORPORATION UK LIMITED, acting through its registered office at 10 Harewood Avenue, London NW1 6AA, as Issuer security trustee (in such capacity, the “Issuer Security Trustee”). WHEREAS (A) The Lessor has purchased or will purchase French Vehicles from various parties on arm’s-length terms pursuant to one or more other motor vehicle purchase agreements or otherwise, in each case, that the Lessor determines shall be leased hereunder. (B) The Lessor desires to lease to each Lessee and each Lessee desires to lease from the Lessor certain Lease Vehicles for use in connection with the business of such Lessee, including use by such Lessee’s employees, directors, officers, representatives, agents and other business associates in their personal or professional capacities. (C) The Lessor and each Lessee desire the Servicer to perform various servicing functions with respect to the Lease Vehicles (to the extent relating to the Vehicles purported to be leased pursuant to this Agreement), and the Servicer desires to perform such functions, in accordance with the terms hereof.

1.2 Rules of Construction (a) In this Agreement, including the preamble, recitals, attachments, schedules, annexes, exhibits and joinders hereto, unless the context otherwise requires, words and expressions used have the constructions ascribed to them in Clause 2 (Principles of Interpretation and Construction) of the Master Definitions and Constructions Agreement. (b) If any obligations of a party to this Agreement or provisions of this Agreement are subject to or contrary to any mandatory principles of applicable law, compliance with such obligations and/or provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be subject to such mandatory principles (or waived) to the extent necessary to be in compliance with such law. (c) In this Agreement, the term “sub-lease” means any underlease, sub-lease, license or mandate in relation to the use of a Lease Vehicle between a Lessee, as lessor, and a sub-lessee, as lessee but does not include, for the avoidance of doubt, any arrangements and normal business operations involving the ultimate return of Lease Vehicles from locations not operated by a Lessee to drop locations of such Lessee (and ancillary use or transportation of such Lease Vehicles in relation thereto). (d) Each Lessee and the Lessor agrees that the role of Hertz France SAS as third party holder shall prevail over its role as Lessee or Servicer and that in the event of any conflict or discrepancy between the French Vehicle Pledge Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of the French Vehicle Pledge Agreement shall prevail. (e) Words in French used in this Agreement and having a specific legal meaning should prevail over the English translation. 1.3 Effectiveness The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the rights and obligations under this Agreement shall become effective at the Effective Time. 2 NATURE OF AGREEMENT (a) Each Lessee and the Lessor acknowledges that the relationship between the Lessor and each Lessee pursuant to this Agreement shall be only that of a lessor and a lessee and that any lease of Lease Vehicles granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be a lease governed by French law and title to the Lease Vehicles will at all times remain with the Lessor. No Lessee shall acquire by virtue of this Agreement any right, title or interest in or to or option to purchase any Lease Vehicles, except the leasehold interest established by this Agreement. The parties agree that this Agreement is a lease on arm’s length terms and agree to treat the leasehold interest established by this Agreement over each Lease Vehicle as a lease (location simple) of such Lease Vehicle governed by articles 1713 and seq. of the French Code civil for all purposes, including accounting, regulatory and otherwise, and not a crédit-bail or a vente à tempérament or a location-vente. (b) Each Lessor and the Lessee hereby confirms to and for the benefit of French Security Trustee and FleetCo Secured Parties that it is the intention of each Lessor and the Lessee that: (i) this French Master Lease constitutes a single indivisible lease of all the Vehicles subject to such French Master Lease and not separate leases governed by similar terms; and (ii) this French Master Lease is intended for all purposes (including in the case of bankruptcy) to be a single lease with respect to all Vehicles subject to such French Master Lease. 2 WEIL: Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 7 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

(iii) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties contained in Clause 7 (Certain Representations and Warranties) are true and correct in all material respects (unless any such representation or warranty contains a materiality limitation by its terms, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct) as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty by its terms makes reference to a specific date, in which case, such representation or warranty shall be true and correct for such specific date); (iv) Eligible Vehicle.

Such Lease Vehicle has been ordered in accordance with the terms of the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement; (vi) Lease Expiration Date. The Lease Expiration Date has not occurred; and (vii) Payment. If such Lease Vehicle was purchased by French FleetCo on non-credit terms, French FleetCo has paid in full the purchase price for such Lease Vehicle and if such Lease Vehicle was purchased on credit terms by French FleetCo, such Lease Vehicle has been delivered to or (as the case may be) is available for collection by French FleetCo. (d) Lease Vehicle Purchases and Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedules (i) Each Lessee may from time to time request that the Lessor acquires vehicles for the purpose of leasing such vehicles in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (which request may be amended or cancelled in such Lessee’s sole discretion before the delivery of the relevant Vehicle provided that no French Leasing Company Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, and provided further that the Lessor shall only be obliged to accept such amendment or cancellation subject to being able to make an amendment or cancellation to the corresponding vehicle order under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement or Sale Agreement and, to the extent that the Lessor will incur any Liability as a result thereof and the relevant Manufacturer or Dealer confirms that such a Liability is due, the Lessor having received full payment from the Lessee for any such Liabilities). The Lessor may, in its absolute discretion, and provided that the conditions precedent in Clause 2.1(c) (Conditions Precedent to Lease of Lease Vehicles) above have been satisfied or waived by the French Security Trustee, order the relevant vehicles in accordance with the terms of the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement. (ii) Any order of Vehicles will be made by French Opco acting in its capacity as French Servicer on behalf of French Fleetco. The Lessor shall not incur any Liability of any type whatsoever if it does not or cannot accept any order of new Vehicle (including if the conditions precedent set out under Clause 2.1(c) (Conditions Precedent to Lease of Lease Vehicles) are satisfied). (iii) Before making any order of Vehicle, the French Servicer shall verify that the conditions precedent set out under Clause 2.1(c) (Conditions Precedent to Lease of Lease Vehicles) are or will be complied with. Any waiver of a condition precedent will require the prior written consent of the French Security Trustee. (iv) Each Lessee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Lessor one or more schedules identifying the vehicles which the Lessor has acquired pursuant to a Vehicle Purchasing Agreement following a request by such Lessee, which schedules shall include the Basic Lease Vehicle Information (each such schedule, a “Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule”). Each Lessee hereby agrees that each Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 11 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

such delivery of a Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule shall be deemed hereunder to constitute a representation and warranty by such Lessee, to and in favor of the Lessor, that each condition precedent to the leasing of the Lease Vehicles identified in such Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule has been satisfied as of the date on which the relevant Lease Vehicles were ordered and delivered. (v) During the period from the Vehicle Lease Commencement Date in respect of a Lease Vehicle to the date that such Lease Vehicle is first identified on a Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule, the existence of a lease between the Lessor and a Lessee in respect of that Lease Vehicle shall be evidenced and determined by reference to the records of the Lessor (which such records shall be held to be correct for all purposes unless manifestly erroneous). (vi) The Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule for each Lease Vehicle to be leased hereunder on the Closing Date shall be substantially in the form as set out in Schedule VIII (Form of Initial Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule). (e) The Lessee shall indemnify the Lessor in respect of any Liabilities which the Lessor may suffer in circumstances where the Lessor has ordered a Vehicle or Vehicles in accordance with the terms of the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement and (i) the Lessee has cancelled or amended the aforementioned Vehicle or Vehicles and/or (ii) the Lessor has accepted an order but subsequently is made aware of an event which would give rise to a Master Lease Termination Notice being served and rejects such notice, and/or (iii) a lease is not entered into by the date on which the Lessor pays the purchase price for such Vehicle or Vehicles (including, without limitation, where a lease is not entered into because the conditions precedent in Clause 2.1(c) (Conditions Precedent to Lease of Lease Vehicles) above are not satisfied). (f) Lease Vehicle Acceptance or Non-conforming Lease Vehicle Rejection. (i) Subject to Sub-Clause 2.1(f)(ii) below, with respect to any vehicle identified on a Lease Vehicle Acquisition Schedule and made available for lease by the Lessor to any Lessee, such Lessee shall have the right to inspect such vehicle within five (5) days of receipt (or such shorter period as may be contemplated under the applicable Vehicle Purchasing Agreement) (the “Inspection Period”) of such vehicle and either accept or, if such vehicle is a Non-conforming Lease Vehicle, reject such vehicle; provided that, such Lessee shall be deemed to have accepted such vehicle as a Lease Vehicle unless it has notified the Lessor in writing that such vehicle is a Non-conforming Lease Vehicle during the Inspection Period (the delivery date of such written notice, the “Rejection Date”). If such Lessee timely notifies the Lessor that such Vehicle is a Non-conforming Lease Vehicle, then such Non-conforming Lease Vehicle with respect to which such Lessee has so notified the Lessor shall be a “Rejected Vehicle”. (ii) Notwithstanding Sub-Clause 2.1(f)(i) above, a Lessee will only be entitled to reject any Lease Vehicle delivered to it by or on behalf of the Lessor (A) if the Lessor is itself entitled to reject such Lease Vehicle under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement pursuant to which such Vehicle was ordered and (B) subject to the same conditions (to the extent applicable) as to rejection as may be applicable to the Lessor under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement in respect of such Vehicle. (iii) The Lessor shall cause the Servicer to dispose of a Rejected Vehicle described in sub-paragraph (i) above (including by returning such Rejected Vehicle to the seller thereof in accordance with the terms of the applicable Vehicle Purchasing Agreement) in accordance with Sub-Clause 6.1 (Servicer functions with respect to Lease Vehicle Returns, Disposition and Invoicing). 5 WEIL: Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 13 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

2.2 Certain Transfers (a) Sales to Lessee. Unless a Lease Event of default has occurred and is continuing, the Lessor and the relevant Lessee may from time to time, in their absolute discretion, agree for the Lessor to sell a Lease Vehicle during such Lease Vehicle’s Vehicle Term to the relevant Lessee for an amount equal to the net book value under GAAP of such Lease Vehicle. (b) Intra-Lease Transfers. From time to time, a particular Lessee (the “Transferor Lessee”) may desire to cease leasing a Lease Vehicle hereunder and another Lessee (the “Transferee Lessee”) may desire to commence leasing such Lease Vehicle hereunder. Upon delivery by such Lessees to the Lessor of written notice identifying by VIN each Lease Vehicle to be so transferred from such Transferor Lessee to such Transferee Lessee (such notice, an “Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule”), each Lease Vehicle identified in such Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule shall cease to be leased by the Transferor Lessee and shall contemporaneously commence being leased to the Transferee Lessee, provided that such transfer does not result in the breach of any prescribed limits relating to Lease Vehicles set out in the Related Documents. Each Lessee agrees that upon such a transfer of any Lease Vehicle from one Lessee to another Lessee pursuant to this Agreement, such Transferor Lessee relinquishes all rights that it has in such Lease Vehicle pursuant to this Agreement. Each Intra-Lease Lessee Transfer Schedule may be delivered electronically and may be delivered directly by either the applicable Transferor Lessee or the applicable Transferee Lessee or on behalf of either such party by any agent or designee of such party. In accordance with article 1216 of the French Code civil, the Lessor hereby agrees in advance to any transfer of lease agreement between a Transferor Lessee and a Transferee Lessee. 2.3 Transfer of Risks As of the relevant Vehicle Lease Commencement Date, and until the later of: (a) the Vehicle Lease Expiration Date; or (b) such time at which the Lessee and the relevant sub-lessee (if any) no longer possesses such Lease Vehicle and the risk of loss, damage, theft, taking, destruction, attachment, seizure, confiscation or requisition with respect to such Lease Vehicle has been transferred to any third party, the Lessee assumes and bears the risk of loss, damage, theft, taking, destruction, attachment, seizure, confiscation or requisition with respect to such Lease Vehicle, however caused or occasioned, and all other risks and liabilities relating to the Lease Vehicle. 2.4 Return (a) Lessee Right to Return. Any Lessee may return any Lease Vehicle (other than any Lease Vehicle that has experienced a Casualty or become an Ineligible Vehicle) then leased by such Lessee at any time prior to such Lease Vehicle’s French Master Lease Scheduled Expiration Date to the Servicer at the location for such Lease Vehicle’s return reasonably specified by the Servicer; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Vehicle Term for such Lease Vehicle will continue until the Vehicle Lease Expiration Date thereof, notwithstanding the prior return of such Lease Vehicle pursuant to this Sub-Clause 2.4(a) (Lessee Right to Return). (b) Lessee Obligation to Return. (i) Each Lessee shall return each Lease Vehicle leased by such Lessee on or prior to such Lease Vehicle’s French Master Lease Scheduled Expiration Date to the Servicer at the location for such Lease Vehicle’s return reasonably specified by Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 15 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

the Servicer (taking into account transportation costs and expected realizable disposition proceeds). (ii) Each Lessee shall return each Lease Vehicle leased by such Lessee upon the Vehicle Lease Expiration Date to the Lessor unless a Disposition Date has occurred in respect of such Lease Vehicle. 2.5 Redesignation of Vehicles (a) Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations. With respect to any Lease Vehicle that is a Program Vehicle leased by any Lessee hereunder as of any date of determination, the Lessor shall on the date specified in Sub-Clause 2.5(d) (Timing of Redesignations) redesignate such Lease Vehicle as a Non-Program Vehicle, if: (i) a Manufacturer Event of Default is continuing with respect to the Manufacturer of such Lease Vehicle as of such date; or (ii) as of any such date occurring after the Minimum Program Term End Date with respect to such Lease Vehicle, such Lease Vehicle was returned as of such date pursuant to the terms of the Manufacturer Program with respect to such Lease Vehicle, the Manufacturer of such Lease Vehicle would not be obligated to pay a repurchase price for such Lease Vehicle, or guarantee the disposition proceeds to be received for such Vehicle, in each case in an amount at least equal to (1) the Net Book Value of such Lease Vehicle, as of such date, minus (2) the Final Base Rent that would be payable in respect of such Lease Vehicle, assuming that such date were the Disposition Date for such Lease Vehicle, minus (3) the Excess Mileage Charges with respect to such Lease Vehicle, that would be applicable as of such date, assuming that such date were the Disposition Date, minus (4) the Excess Damage Charges with respect to such Lease Vehicle, that would be applicable as of such date, assuming that such date were the Disposition Date, minus (5) the Pre- VLCD Program Vehicle Depreciation Amount paid or payable with respect to such Lease Vehicle, as of such date, minus (6) the Program Vehicle Depreciation Assumption True-Up Amount paid or payable with respect to such Lease Vehicle, as of such date. (b) Optional Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations. In addition to Sub-Clause 2.5(a) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations) and without limitation thereto, with respect to any Lease Vehicle that is a Program Vehicle leased by any Lessee hereunder as of any date of determination, such Lessee may redesignate such Lease Vehicle as a Non-Program Vehicle upon written notice to the Lessor (which written notice may be delivered electronically and may be delivered directly by such Lessee or on its behalf by any agent or designee of such Lessee); provided that, such Lessee shall not redesignate any Program Vehicle as a Non-Program Vehicle pursuant to this Sub-Clause 2.5(b) (Optional Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations) if, after giving effect to such redesignation, an Aggregate Asset Amount Deficiency would exist, unless such redesignation would decrease the amount of such Aggregate Asset Amount Deficiency. (c) Non-Program Vehicle to Program Vehicle Redesignations. With respect to any Lease Vehicle that is a Non- Program Vehicle leased by any Lessee hereunder as of any date of determination, if such Lease Vehicle was previously designated as a Program Vehicle, then such Lessee may redesignate such Lease Vehicle as a Program Vehicle upon written notice to the Lessor (which written notice may be delivered electronically and may be delivered directly by such Lessee or on its behalf by any agent or designee of such Lessee); provided that, such Lessee may not redesignate any such Lease Vehicle as a Program Vehicle if such Lease Vehicle would then be required to be redesignated as a Non-Program Vehicle pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.5(a) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 17 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

With respect to any Lease Vehicle that is redesignated as a Non-Program Vehicle pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.5(a) (Mandatory Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations) or Sub-Clause 2.5(b) (Optional Program Vehicle to Non-Program Vehicle Redesignations), the Lessee of such Lease Vehicle as of the close of business on the date of such redesignation shall pay to the Lessor on the Payment Date following the effective date of such redesignation, as determined in accordance with Sub-Clause 2.5(d) (Timing of Redesignations), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Net Book Value of such Lease Vehicle over the Market Value of such Lease Vehicle, in each case, as of the date of such redesignation (such excess, if any, for such Lease Vehicle, a “Redesignation to Non-Program Amount”). (f) Non-Program Vehicle to Program Vehicle Redesignation Payments. With respect to any Lease Vehicle that is redesignated as a Program Vehicle pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.5(c) (Non-Program Vehicle to Program Vehicle Redesignations), the Lessor shall pay to the Lessee of such Lease Vehicle on the Payment Date following the effective date of such redesignation, as determined in accordance with Sub-Clause 2.5(d) (Timing of Redesignations), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Net Book Value of such Lease Vehicle (as of the date of such redesignation and calculated assuming that such Lease Vehicle had never been designated as a Non-Program Vehicle) over the Net Book Value of such Lease Vehicle (as of the date of such redesignation but without giving effect to such Lease Vehicle’s redesignation as a Program Vehicle) (such excess, if any, for such Lease Vehicle and such redesignation, the “Redesignation to Program Amount”); provided that, (i) no payment shall be required to be made and no payment may be made by the Lessor pursuant to this Sub-Clause 2.5(f) (Non-Program Vehicle to Program Vehicle Redesignation Payments) to the extent that an Amortization Event or a Potential Amortization Event exists or would be caused by such payment; (ii) the amount of any such payment to be made by the Lessor on any such date shall be capped at and be paid from (and the obligation of the Lessor to make such payment on such date shall be limited to) the amount of funds available to the Lessor on such date; and (iii) if any such payment from the Lessor is limited in amount pursuant to the foregoing paragraph (i) or (ii), the Lessor shall pay to such Lessee the funds available to the Lessor on such Payment Date and shall pay to such Lessee on each Payment Date thereafter the amount available to the Lessor until such Redesignation to Program Amount has been paid in full to such Lessee. 2.6 Hell-or-High-Water Lease Each Lessee’s obligation to pay all rent and other sums hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be subject to any abatement, setoff (except as required under Sub- 8 Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 19 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

9.1.2 any unauthorized assignment or transfer of this Agreement by any Lessee occurs; 9.1.3 the failure of any Lessee to observe or perform any other covenant, condition, agreement or provision hereof, including, but not limited to, usage, and maintenance that in any such case has a Lease Material Adverse Effect, and such default continues for more than fourteen (14) consecutive days after the earlier of the date written notice thereof is delivered by the Lessor or the French Security Trustee to such Lessee or the date an Authorized Officer of such Lessee obtains actual knowledge thereof; 9.1.4 if (i) any representation or warranty made by any Lessee herein is inaccurate or incorrect or is breached or is false or misleading as of the date of the making thereof or any schedule, certificate, financial statement, report, notice, or other writing furnished by or on behalf of any Lessee to the Lessor or the French Security Trustee is false or misleading on the date as of which the facts therein set forth are stated or certified, (ii) such inaccuracy, breach or falsehood has a Lease Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) the circumstance or condition in respect of which such representation, warranty or writing was inaccurate, incorrect, breached, false or misleading, as the case may be, shall not have been eliminated or otherwise cured for fourteen (14) consecutive days after the earlier of (x) the date of the receipt of written notice thereof from the Lessor or the French Security Trustee to the applicable Lessee and (y) the date an Authorized Officer of the applicable Lessee learns of such circumstance or condition; 9.1.5 an Event of Bankruptcy occurs with respect to Hertz or with respect to any Lessee; 9.1.6 this Agreement or any portion thereof ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with its terms or as otherwise expressly permitted in the French Related Documents) or a proceeding shall be commenced by any Lessee to establish the invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement, in each case other than with respect to any Lessee that at such time is not leasing any Lease Vehicles hereunder; 9.1.7 a Servicer Default occurs; or 9.1.8 a Liquidation Event occurs.

If any Lease Event of Default set forth in Sub-Clauses 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.1.5, 9.1.6 or 9.1.8 (Events of Default) shall occur and be continuing, the Lessee’s right of possession with respect to any Lease Vehicles leased hereunder shall be subject to the Lessor’s option to terminate such right as set forth in Sub-Clauses 9.3 (Rights of Lessor Upon Lease Event of Default) and 9.4 (Liquidation Event and Non-Performance of Certain Covenants). 9.3 Rights of Lessor and French Security Trustee Upon Lease Event of Default 9.3.1 If a Lease Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, then the Lessor may proceed by appropriate court action or actions, at law to enforce performance by any Lessee of the applicable covenants and terms of this Agreement or to recover damages for the breach hereof calculated in accordance with Sub-Clause 9.5 (Measure of Damages). 9.3.2 If any Lease Event of Default set forth in Sub-Clause 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.1.5, 9.1.6 or 9.1.8 (Events of Default) shall occur and be continuing, then (i) subject to the terms of this Clause 9.3.2, the Lessor or the French Security Trustee (acting on the written instructions of the Issuer Security Trustee (whose instructions, in turn, have been obtained in accordance with the terms of the French Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 63 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

The Lessor may not validly serve a Master Lease Termination Notice unless such decision to serve the Master Lease Termination Notice has been approved by the independent chairman (président) of the Lessor. 9.3.3 Each and every power and remedy hereby specifically given to the Lessor will be in addition to every other power and remedy hereby specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law or in bankruptcy and each and every power and remedy may be exercised from time to time and simultaneously and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Lessor; provided, however, that the measure of damages recoverable against such Lessee will in any case be calculated in accordance with Sub-Clause 9.5 (Measure of Damages). All such powers and remedies will be cumulative, and the exercise of one will not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other or others. No delay or omission of the Lessor in the exercise of any such power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any payments due hereunder will impair any such power or remedy or will be construed to be a waiver of any default or any acquiescence therein; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any exercise of any such right or power shall remain subject to each condition expressly specified in any Related Document with respect to such exercise. Any extension of time for payment hereunder or other indulgence duly granted to any Lessee will not otherwise alter or affect the Lessor’s rights or the obligations hereunder of such Lessee. The Lessor’s acceptance of any payment after it will have become due hereunder will not be deemed to alter or affect the Lessor’s rights hereunder with respect to any subsequent payments or defaults therein. 9.3.4 In addition, following the occurrence of an Lease Event of Default, the Lessor shall have all of the rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims vis-à-vis each Lessee, necessary or desirable to allow the French Security Trustee to exercise the rights, remedies, power, privileges and claims given to the French Security Trustee pursuant to Sub- Clause 11.2 (Rights of the French Security Trustee upon Amortization Event or Certain Other Events of Default) of the French Facility Agreement, and each Lessee acknowledges that it has hereby granted to the Lessor all such rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims granted by the Lessor to the French Security Trustee pursuant to Clause 11 (Amortization Events and Remedies) of the French Facility Agreement and that the French Security Trustee may act in lieu of the Lessor in the exercise of all such rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims. 9.4 Liquidation Event and Non-Performance of Certain Covenants (a) If a Liquidation Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the French Security Trustee and the Issuer Security Trustee shall have the rights against each Lessee and the French Collateral provided in the French Security Trust Deed and Issuer Security Trust Deed, upon a Liquidation Event, including, in each case, the right to serve a Master Lease Termination Notice on the other parties hereto and following service of such notice shall have the right (i) to terminate any Lessee’s rights of possession hereunder of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles leased hereunder by such Lessee (ii) to take possession of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles leased by any Lessee hereunder and (iii) to peaceably enter upon the premises of any Lessee or other premises where Lease Vehicles may be located and take possession of all or a portion of the Lease Vehicles and 32 WEIL: Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 65 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

(b) During the continuance of a Liquidation Event, the Servicer shall return any or all Lease Vehicles that are Program Vehicles to the related Manufacturers in accordance with the instructions of the Lessor. To the extent any Manufacturer fails to accept any such Program Vehicles under the terms of the applicable Manufacturer Program, the Lessor shall have the right to otherwise dispose of such Program Vehicles and to direct the Servicer to dispose of such Program Vehicles in accordance with its instructions. (c) Notwithstanding the exercise of any rights or remedies pursuant to this Sub-Clause 9.4 (Liquidation Event and Non-Performance of Certain Covenants), the Lessor will, nevertheless, have a right to recover from such Lessee any and all amounts (for the avoidance of doubt, as limited by Sub-Clause 9.5 (Measure of Damages)) as may be then due. (d) In addition, following the occurrence of a Liquidation Event, the Lessor shall have all of the rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims vis-a-vis each Lessee, necessary or desirable to allow the French Security Trustee to exercise the rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims given to the French Security Trustee pursuant to Sub-Clause 11.2 (Rights of the French Security Trustee upon Amortization Event or Certain Other Events of Default) of the French Facility Agreement, and each Lessee acknowledges that it has hereby granted to the Lessor all such rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims granted by the Lessor to the French Security Trustee pursuant to Clause 11 (Amortization Events and Remedies) of the French Facility Agreement and that the French Security Trustee may act in lieu of the Lessor in the exercise of all such rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims. (e) The French Security Trustee may only take possession of, or exercise any of the rights or remedies specified in this Agreement with respect to, such number of Lease Vehicles necessary to generate disposition proceeds in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the French Advances with respect to which a Liquidation Event is then continuing as set forth in the Issuer Facility Agreement, taking into account the receipt of proceeds of all other vehicles being disposed of that have been pledged to secure such French Advances. 9.5 Measure of Damages If a Lease Event of Default or Liquidation Event occurs and the Lessor or the French Security Trustee exercises the remedies granted to the Lessor or the French Security Trustee under this Clause 9 (Default and Remedies Therefor) or Sub-Clause 11.2 (Rights of the French Security Trustee upon Amortization Event or Certain Other Events of Default) of the French Facility Agreement, the amount that the Lessor shall be permitted to recover from any Lessee as payment shall be equal to: (i) all Rent for each Lease Vehicle leased by such Lessee hereunder to the extent accrued and unpaid as of the earlier of the date of the return to the Lessor of such Lease Vehicle or disposition by the Servicer of such Lease Vehicle in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all other payments payable under this Agreement by such Lessee, accrued and unpaid as of such date; plus (ii) any reasonable out-of-pocket damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses that the Lessor or the French Security Trustee will have sustained by reason of such a Lease Event of Default or Liquidation Event, together with reasonable sums for such attorneys’ fees and such expenses as will be expended or incurred in the seizure, storage, rental or sale of the Lease Vehicles leased by such Lessee hereunder or in the enforcement of any right or privilege hereunder or in any consultation or action in such connection, in each case to the extent reasonably attributable to such Lessee; plus 33 WEIL: Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 67 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

Accordingly, each Lessee agrees that: (i) subject to the terms of the French Security Trust Deed and the relevant French Security Document, the French Security Trustee shall have all the rights powers, privileges and remedies of the Lessor hereunder; (ii) upon the delivery by the French Security Trustee of any notice to such Lessee stating that a Lease Event of Default or a Liquidation Event has occurred, such Lessee acknowledges that pursuant to this Agreement, it has agreed to make all payments of Rent hereunder (and any other payments hereunder) directly to the French Security Trustee for deposit in the French Transaction Account. 13.2 Right of the Lessor to Assign this Agreement The Lessor shall have the right to finance the acquisition and ownership of Lease Vehicles under this Agreement by, without limitation, selling or assigning its right, title and interest in this Agreement, including, without limitation, in moneys due from any Lessee and any third party under this Agreement, to the French Secured Parties under the French Security Documents; provided, however, that any such sale or assignment shall be subject to the rights and interest of the Lessees in the Lease Vehicles, including but not limited to the Lessees’ right of quiet and peaceful possession of such Lease Vehicles as set forth in Sub-Clause 5.3 (Non-Disturbance) hereof, and under this Agreement. 13.3 Limitations on the Right of the Lessees to Assign this Agreement No Lessee shall assign this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder to any other party; provided, however, that (i) each Lessee may rent the Lease Vehicles leased by such Lessee hereunder in connection with its business and may use and sublease Lease Vehicles pursuant to Sub-Clause 5.2 (Vehicle Use) and (ii) each Lessee may delegate to one or more of its Affiliates the performance of any of such Lessee’s obligations as Lessee hereunder (but such Lessee shall remain fully liable for its obligations hereunder). Any purported assignment in violation of this Sub-Clause 13.3 (Limitations on the Right of the Lessees to Assign this Agreement) shall be void and of no force or effect. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to restrict the right of any Lessee to acquire or dispose of, by purchase, lease, financing, or otherwise, motor vehicles that are not subject to the provisions of this Agreement. 13.4 Security The Lessor may grant security interests in the Lease Vehicles leased by any Lessee hereunder without consent of any Lessee. Except for Permitted Security, each Lessee shall keep all Lease Vehicles free of all Security arising during the Term.

Lease Vehicle, that such Lease Vehicle is in good order and condition and is of the manufacture, design, specifications and capacity selected by such Lessee, that such Lessee is satisfied that the same is suitable for this use. Each Lessee acknowledges that the Lessor is not a Manufacturer or agent thereof or primarily engaged in the sale or distribution of Lease Vehicles. Each Lessee acknowledges that the Lessor makes no representation, warranty or covenant, express or implied in any such case, as to the fitness, safeness, design, merchantability, condition, quality, durability, suitability, capacity or workmanship of the Lease Vehicles in any respect or in connection with or for any purposes or uses of any Lessee and makes no representation, warranty or covenant, express or implied in any such case, that the Lease Vehicles will satisfy the requirements of any law or any contract specification, and as between the Lessor and each Lessee, such Lessee agrees to bear all such risks at its sole cost and expense.

The Lessor shall not be liable for any failure to perform any provision hereof resulting from fire or other casualty, natural disaster, riot or other civil unrest, war, terrorism, strike or other labor difficulty, governmental regulation or restriction, or any cause beyond the Lessor’s direct control. In no event shall the Lessor be liable for any inconveniences, loss of profits or any other special, incidental, or consequential damages, whatsoever or howsoever caused (including resulting from any defect in or any theft, damage, loss or failure of any Lease Vehicle.

Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees with and acknowledges to each of French FleetCo and the French Security Trustee until the date falling eighteen months and one day after the Legal Final Payment Date, that: (a) it shall not have the right to take or join any person in taking any steps against French FleetCo for the purpose of obtaining payment of any amount due from French FleetCo (other than serving a written demand subject to the terms of the French Security Trust Deed and the French Priority of Payments); and (b) neither it nor any Person on its behalf shall initiate or join any person in initiating an Event of Bankruptcy or the appointment of any Insolvency Official in relation to French FleetCo.

15.2 Obligations as Corporate Obligations (a) No Party shall have any recourse against nor shall any personal liability attach to any shareholder, officer, agent, employee or director of French FleetCo or the French Security Trustee in his capacity as such, by any Proceedings or otherwise, in respect of any obligation, covenant, or agreement of French FleetCo or the French Security Trustee contained in this Agreement. (b) The Parties, other than French FleetCo, shall not have any liability for the obligations of French FleetCo and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute the giving of a guarantee, an indemnity or the assumption of a similar obligation by any of such other Parties in respect of the performance by French FleetCo of its obligations. The provisions of this Sub-Clause 15.2 (Obligations as Corporate Obligations) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 15.3 Limited Recourse in respect of French FleetCo Each party to this Agreement agrees with and acknowledges to each of French FleetCo and the French Security Trustee that, notwithstanding any other provision of any French Related Document, all obligations of French FleetCo to such entity are limited in recourse as set out below: (c) Priority of payments. All payments to be made by French FleetCo hereunder to any party will be made only from and to the extent of the sums payable to such party in accordance with the terms of the French Priority of Payments. Accordingly, each party expressly and irrevocably waives any remedy against French FleetCo (acting in whatever capacity) in connection with the payment of any amounts that may be due to it under any Related Document otherwise than up to the amounts payable to it in accordance with the terms of the French Priority of Payments; (d) Deferral. Any liability remaining unpaid after application of the French Priority of Payments shall automatically be deferred and be payable (exigible) on the immediately following Payment Date (except if a different rule in relation to deferred payments is set out in the agreement from which the relevant unpaid liability arises) until the Legal Final Payment Date, in accordance with the French Priority of Payments applicable on that day but in priority to the amounts due on that date and having the same or similar ranking as the deferred amount (unless no such liability as the deferred liability is due on that day in which case such deferred liability will be paid in priority to all other liabilities due on such date), commencing with the oldest deferred amount outstanding and progressing to each next older outstanding deferred amount until such time as no deferred amount remains outstanding. (e) Insufficient Recoveries. If, or to the extent that, after allocation of all amounts in accordance with the foregoing and, as the case may be, after the French Collateral has been as fully as practicable realised and the proceeds thereof have been applied in accordance with the French Priority of Payments, such proceeds are insufficient to pay or discharge amounts due from French FleetCo to the French Secured Parties or any party to this Agreement in full for any reason, French FleetCo will have no liability to pay or otherwise make good any such insufficiency. The provisions of this Sub-Clause 15.3 (Limited recourse in respect of French FleetCo) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Irrespective of whether or not this Sub-Clause 15.3 (Limited recourse in respect of French FleetCo) is incorporated into any other Related Document, the Parties agree that this Sub-Clause 15.3 (Limited recourse in respect of French FleetCo) shall apply to all Related Documents to which the French FleetCo is a party to the fullest extent possible. 38 WEIL: Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 77 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

If any Vehicle Purchasing Agreement provides that French OpCo (or any other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo) may purchase/sell Vehicles in accordance with the terms of such Vehicle Purchasing Agreement, the obligations of French FleetCo and French OpCo (or other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo, as applicable) under that Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will in all cases need to be several (non solidaires), and provide that French FleetCo will not have any liability for the obligations of French OpCo (or such other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation, as applicable). Alternatively, existing Vehicle Purchasing Agreements to which French OpCo (or other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo) is a party may be amended to provide that French FleetCo may accede to such Vehicle Purchasing Agreements (satisfying the French Required Contractual Criteria) and that French FleetCo will not have any liability for the obligations of French OpCo (or other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation). 1.2 Separate obligations Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will satisfy the following criteria: (a) French FleetCo shall not under any circumstances have any liability for the obligations of French OpCo (in its capacity as guarantor, purchaser of vehicles or otherwise) thereunder; and (b) to the extent that French OpCo (or any other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo) enters into or is a party to any other Vehicle Purchasing Agreements with the same Manufacturer /Dealer (each such Vehicle Purchasing Agreement to which French OpCo or other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo is a party being a “French OpCo Specific Agreement”), French FleetCo shall not under any circumstances have any liability for the obligations of French OpCo (or such other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation, as the case may be) under such French OpCo Specific Agreement. 1.3 Volume Rebates etc. A Vehicle Purchasing Agreement may provide that any bonus payment or other amount (howsoever described) payable or to be made available by a Manufacturer /Dealer as a result of French FleetCo (or French FleetCo and/or French OpCo (and/or any other relevant Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation) under such Vehicle Purchasing Agreement and/or any French OpCo Specific Agreement, as applicable) meeting any minimum vehicle purchase level in that relevant year, be payable to or for the account of French OpCo (rather than French FleetCo). For the avoidance of doubt, French FleetCo may however take the benefit of reductions applied to purchase prices applicable to vehicles as a result of any such minimum vehicle purchase levels being reached.

Notwithstanding the foregoing where a Vehicle Purchasing Agreement provides that in the event that any minimum vehicle purchase level in the relevant year is not met: (a) any bonus, payment, benefit or reductions applied to purchase prices on Vehicles purchased by French FleetCo or other amount (howsoever described) is recoverable by or repayable to a Manufacturer y/Dealer; or (b) any penalty or other amount (howsoever described) is payable to such Manufacturer /Dealer, such Vehicle Purchasing Agreement shall provide that, in each case, such amounts will only be reclaimed from, payable by, or otherwise recoverable from French OpCo or another Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo. 1.4 Confidentiality and public disclosure of terms of Vehicle Purchasing Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will need to be disclosed to the French Security Trustee and possibly other Enhancement Providers. 1.5 Non-petition Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will contain an irrevocable and unconditional covenant or undertaking given by the relevant Manufacturer /Dealer that such Manufacturer /Dealer shall not be entitled and shall not initiate or take any step in connection with: (a) liquidation, bankruptcy or insolvency (or any similar or analogous proceedings or circumstances) of French FleetCo; or (b) the appointment of an insolvency officer in relation to French FleetCo or any of its assets whatsoever, provided that, to the extent that a Vehicle Purchasing Agreement provides that such covenant or undertaking will terminate upon a given date, such date shall be no earlier than the date falling eighteen months and one day after the Legal Final Payment Date. 1.6 Limited recourse Each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement will contain an irrevocable covenant or undertaking given by the relevant Manufacturer /Dealer that such Manufacturer /Dealer shall not be entitled to, and shall not, initiate or take any step in connection with the commencement of legal proceedings (howsoever described) to recover any amount owed to it by French FleetCo under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement; this covenant will be unconditional except that the relevant Manufacturer /Dealer may commence legal proceedings to the extent that the only relief sought against French FleetCo pursuant to such proceedings is the re-possession of relevant Vehicle(s) pursuant to applicable retention of title provisions provided for under the relevant Vehicle Purchasing Agreement, provided that, to the extent that a Vehicle Purchasing Agreement provides that such covenant or undertaking will terminate upon a given date, such date shall be no earlier than the date falling eighteen months and one day after the Legal Final Payment Date. 2 PROVISIONS TO BE APPLIED TO ALL MANUFACTURER PROGRAMS TO BE ENTERED INTO BY A FLEETCO Each Manufacturer Program will in substance satisfy the following additional contractual requirements: 2.1 Assignment and transfers Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 101 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

Each Manufacturer Program will contain terms that permit French FleetCo to assign by way of security or pledge any of its rights under such agreement to the French Secured Parties. Any such right to grant security to the French Secured Parties must be unrestricted. Unless pursuant to an Intra-Group Transfer (as defined below) by a Manufacturer (which shall not require consent from French FleetCo), each Manufacturer Program will provide that the Manufacturer/Dealer may not assign, transfer or novate its obligations under such agreement without the prior written consent of French FleetCo. French FleetCo shall not provide such consent unless the Manufacturer /Dealer enters into a guarantee materially in the form set out in Schedule 3 (Draft Transfer and Guarantee Language to be included in Pro Forma Manufacturer Programs) or accepts joint and several liability in respect of the transferred obligations substantially on the terms set out in Schedule IV (Draft Transfer and Joint and Several Liability Language to be included in Pro Forma Manufacturer Programs). For the purposes hereof, an “Intra-Group Transfer” means an assignment, transfer or novation by a Manufacturer of its obligations under a Manufacturer Program to an Affiliate of such Manufacturer which would satisfy the definition of “Investment Grade Manufacturer” upon such Affiliate becoming a Manufacturer. For the avoidance of doubt, Manufacturers /Dealers may assign their rights under Manufacturer Programs without the prior written consent of French FleetCo. 2.2 Set-off Each Manufacturer Program will provide that the Manufacturer/Dealer expressly waives (to the extent that it is able to do so under applicable law) any right that it would otherwise have under such Manufacturer Program or under applicable law to set-off (i) any amount of unpaid purchase price owed to such Manufacturer/Dealer by French FleetCo in relation to Vehicles ordered by (but not delivered to) French FleetCo by such Manufacturer/Dealer under that Manufacturer Program, against (ii) amounts owed by the Manufacturer/Dealer to French FleetCo under such Manufacturer Program, provided that, each Vehicle Purchasing Agreement entered into or renewed on or after the Closing Date will provide that the Manufacturer/Dealer expressly waives (to the extent that it is able to do so under applicable law) any right that it would otherwise have under such Vehicle Purchasing Agreement or under applicable law to set-off (i) any amount of unpaid purchase price owed to such Manufacturer/Dealer by French FleetCo under that Vehicle Purchasing Agreement, against (ii) amounts owed by the Manufacturer/Dealer to French FleetCo under that Manufacturer Program or any other Vehicle Purchasing Agreement, save and except in relation to any Manufacturer Programme with Daimler AG, and/or any of their respective Affiliates or successors or any corporation into which such entities may be merged or converted or with which they may be consolidated or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation of such entities (“Daimler Entities”) or any Dealers or agents (or Affiliates or successors thereof) selling Vehicles manufactured or purchased from the Daimler Entities if such Manufacturer Programme does not provide for waiver of set-off in accordance with paragraph 2.2 (Set-off) hereof, in which case such amounts may be reclaimed from, payable by, or otherwise recoverable from French FleetCo. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Manufacturer /Dealers will be entitled to set off any amount owed by French FleetCo in respect of turn-back related damages against any amount of Repurchase Price owed by it to French FleetCo. The Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to procure that each Manufacturer Program will provide that the Manufacturer /Dealer expressly waives all rights to set-off (however arising, including legal set-off) any amount: (a) owed to it by French OpCo under such Manufacturer Program; or (b) owed to it by French OpCo (or any other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo) under any other agreement (including any French OpCo Specific Agreement), in any such case against amounts owed by the Manufacturer /Dealer to French FleetCo under the relevant Manufacturer Program. 2.3 Manufacturer’s/Dealer’s obligations to be ‘unconditional’ WEIL: Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 103 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM

No Manufacturer Program may contain terms that provide that the Repurchase Obligations of the Manufacturer/ Dealer are conditional in any respect other than, in relation to (a) a force majeure event or (b) compliance with applicable turn-back procedures (including any Programme Minimum Term or Programme Maximum Term) and/or (c) turn-back standards in relation to the condition of the relevant Vehicle. For the avoidance of doubt, no Manufacturer Program may provide that the obligations of the Manufacturer /Dealer thereunder are conditional upon: (a) any minimum number of Vehicles being purchased (i) by French FleetCo under such Manufacturer Program; and/or (ii) by French OpCo or any other Person under such Manufacturer Program or any French OpCo Specific Agreement; or (b) the solvency of French FleetCo; or (c) the solvency of any other Affiliate of The Hertz Corporation other than French FleetCo. 2.4 Termination provisions To the extent that a Manufacturer/Dealer requires express termination provisions to be included in any Manufacturer Program, such Manufacturer Program may provide that a Manufacturer /Dealer is entitled (upon expiry of a predetermined notice period or otherwise) to terminate such agreement before its scheduled expiry date upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g. liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, failure to pay, late payment, partial payment, breach or serious breach of obligations, or any similar or analogous events); provided always that the Manufacturer/ Dealer shall not under any circumstances have the right to terminate its obligations (subject to and in accordance with any eligibility criteria and Programme Minimum Term or Programme Maximum Term) to repurchase (or, if applicable to perform its guaranteed obligations thereunder) in respect of any Vehicle shipped to French FleetCo or its order prior to the termination of such Manufacturer Program. 2.5 Retention of title in favour of French FleetCo The Manufacturer Program entered into with the Top Two Non-Investment Grade Manufacturers will, where credit terms are made available to the relevant Manufacturer /Dealer (in relation to the payment by it of applicable repurchase prices for Vehicles) provide that title to the relevant Vehicle will remain with French FleetCo until the sale proceeds are received by French FleetCo. In practice French FleetCo may return the registration documents for a Vehicle when it is turned back to such Top Two Non-Investment Grade Manufacturers. For these purposes, a 'force majeure event' will be constituted by any event which (a) was not foreseen by the parties, (b) is outside their control and could not have been avoided by taking due care or by compliance in all material respects with obligations under the VPA and (c) prevents performance of the obligations of one or more parties under the contract. 1 1 WEIL: Document https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47129/0001657853... 105 of 140 1/27/25, 1:13 AM
