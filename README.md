## Covenant AI

Covenant AI is a smart lease contract analysis system that leverages Agentic RAG for information retrieval.
The RAG architecture is built without the use of external libraries/frameworks for scalability. 

> For a comprehensive overview, please visit [the offical Covenant AI Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wF_BIUqBmTT5pCod0L1EdVWjJe7RHlbvKfGV_hV0Fkc/edit?usp=sharing) 

## Sample Dataset for Hackathon

The project root has a few sample lease agreements you can use to test the project and its funcationalities.

## Features

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Contract Upload: Users can upload lease contracts in PDF or DOCX format.
- Summary & Insights: Provides an AI-generated summary of key terms.
- Highlight PDF: Highlights the important clauses and obligations in the pdf.
- Interactive Chatbot: Allows users to ask AI-driven questions about the contract.

### Backend (Flask Framework)
- Document Processing: Extracts and parses text from uploaded documents using OCR.
- NLP Analysis: Uses AI models to analyze legal language.
- Database Management: Stores analyzed contracts in the supabase.
- Dynamic ground rules: Update rules and regulations that must be present in agreement. 

### AI Components
1. Summarization: Summarize the uploaded agreements with LLM.
2. Compare agreements: Compare 2 agreements and see which one is better.
3. ChatBot: RAG based chatbot that helps understand jargons.
4. Multiple contracts: Upload multiple PDFs and can chat with any of them.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask Framework, SupaBase
- AI & NLP: SpaCy, Transformers (BERT/GPT), OCR for text extraction
- Cloud & APIs: AWS S3 for file storage, FastAPI for AI models
